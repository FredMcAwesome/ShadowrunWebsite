# Frontend
The frontend was created from scratch (i.e. without create-react-app) to keep things minimal and more customisable.
We also avoid [issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65893787/create-react-app-with-typescript-and-npm-link-enums-causing-module-parse-failed) with npm workspaces by creating it manually

## JS
The frontend uses react with react query for all communication to the server.

## CSS
The site is designed as mobile first. This was decided for the normal reasons
i.e. mobile will be used most, easier to adjust up than down in size with css-queries
